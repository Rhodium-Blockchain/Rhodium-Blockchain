# Rhodium Blockchain

**Rhodium Blockchain** is an innovative, fast, and secure blockchain built on a unique Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, **RhodiumHash**. Our goal is to provide a scalable and decentralized platform for building decentralized applications (DApps) and handling digital assets with low transaction fees and high throughput.

## Features

- **RhodiumHash**: A custom and highly secure Proof of Work (PoW) hashing algorithm.
- **High Throughput**: Designed for fast transaction speeds, aiming to exceed the performance of existing blockchains like Solana.
- **Smart Contracts**: Full support for smart contracts, enabling the creation of decentralized applications.
- **Maximum Supply**: The total supply of Rhodium (RHD) is capped at 25 million tokens.
- **Low Transaction Fees**: With a focus on scalability and efficiency, Rhodium Blockchain offers low transaction fees.
- **Security**: Rhodium Blockchain employs state-of-the-art security features to protect users and developers alike.

## Tokenomics

- **Token Name**: Rhodium (RHD)
- **Max Supply**: 25 million tokens
- **Consensus**: Proof of Work (PoW) using the unique **RhodiumHash** algorithm
- **Smart Contracts**: Supported for decentralized application development

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

To run a node or build the blockchain, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [C++ Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (for building the core software)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)
- [Boost Libraries](https://www.boost.org/)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

### Steps to Set Up a Node

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Rhodium-Blockchain.git
   cd Rhodium-Blockchain
